I. Supervised Learning
- Given: a dataset and correct output
- Categorized into:
  - **Regression**: predict results within a continous output
  - **Classification**: predict results in a discrete output

II. Unsupervised Learning
- Approach problems with little or no idea what results should look like.
- We can drive structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
- There's no feedback based on the prediction results.

III. Gradient Descent
